# testbroker

This is just a very simple MQTT broker that can be used for debugging MQTT problems. It is just a broker that logs a lot.

## Install

This installs the `testbroker` binary if you just want to run and not necessarily fiddle with the code.

```shell
go install github.com/borud/testbroker@latest
```
